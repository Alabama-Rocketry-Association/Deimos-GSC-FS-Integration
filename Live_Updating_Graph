# Code written for ARA (Alabama Rocketry Association), a rocketry club at The University of Alabama.
# Written by Joshua Vondracek, sophomore.
# Purpose of code is to create a live-updating graph to track altitude over time of a rocket launch.
# Continually reads data from text file "Test.txt"
#
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
from matplotlib import style

# A graphing style
style.use('fivethirtyeight')

# Initializes the graph
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)

# The main function that creates the animation
def animate(i):
# Opens text file
    graph_data = open('Test.txt','r').read()
    lines = graph_data.split('\n')
# Empty lists to contain data points
    xs = []
    ys = []
# Enters data points into lists, x and y split by commas in text file
    for line in lines:
        if len(line) > 1:
            x, y = line.split(',')
            xs.append(float(x))
            ys.append(float(y))
    ax1.clear()
# line.set_ydata(xs)
    ax1.plot(xs, ys)
# x-axis label
    plt.xlabel(' Time (seconds)')
# y-axis label
    plt.ylabel('Altitude (m)')
# plot title
    plt.title('Rocket Altitude with Time')

# Controls how often the graph updates/checks for new data(milliseconds)
ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, interval=100)
plt.show()
